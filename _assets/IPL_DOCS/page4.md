# Rules pertaining to BLIND Bidding:

There will be 1 player in every auction
slot whose details won't be disclosed
during the auction. A riddle will be
displayed and teams will have to bid
for that player according to what
they feel is the name of that player.
The player's name and details will be
displayed only after the player has
been sold to a particular team.
