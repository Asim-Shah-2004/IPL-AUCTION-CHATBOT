### FINAL RATING CALCULATION
- THE FINAL RATING WILL BE CALCULATED BY ADDING THE OVERALL RATING OF ALL THE 11 PLAYERS WHICH YOU HAVE BOUGHT, THE BONUS RATINGS ACQUIRED BY THE SAME 11 PLAYERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CATEGORIES YOU PUT THEM INTO, THE CAPTAINCY POINTS (IF EXISTS), AND THE PLAYER CHEMISTRY POINTS (IF APPLICABLE).
- IF A LEGENDARY/WOMEN/UNDERDOG PLAYER IS A FOREIGNER THEN TOO HE/SHE SHALL BE COUNTED IN THE FOREIGNERS LIST.
- IF A TEAM OVERBUYS ANY OF PLAYER IN ANY CATEGORY THEN IT WILL LEAD TO DEDUCTION OF 100 POINTS PER MISTAKE AND THAT CATEGORY PLAYER WILL COME BACK TO THE AUCTION.
- PLAYERS WILL GO UNSOLD IF NONE OF THE TEAMS BID FOR THEM. UNSOLD PLAYERS WILL COME BACK TO THE AUCTION FOR AN ACCELERATED PROCESS AFTER ALL THE PLAYERS HAVE GONE UNDER THE HAMMER ONCE.

### PLAYER CHEMISTRY
- YOU WILL GET 5 BONUS POINTS FOR A PAIR OF PLAYERS WHICH WILL BE MENTIONED IN A PLAYER CHEMISTRY LIST WHICH WILL BE PROVIDED BY US. (LIKE IF TWO PLAYERS HAVE PLAYER CHEMISTRY 2-2 THEN HAVING BOTH WILL ADD +5 POINTS TO THE TOTAL).
For example , lets assume that rohit sharma and suryakumar yadav have been allocated same player chemistry points which means that if a team manages to buy both the players then bonus points will be added to the teams total.

### CAPTAINCY POINTS CONCEPT
- CAPTAINCY POINTS HAVE BEEN ALLOTTED TO CERTAIN PLAYERS.
- IF YOU DECIDE TO MAKE THAT PARTICULAR PLAYER AS THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR TEAM THEN BONUS POINTS MENTIONED WOULD BE ADDED TO THE TOTAL.


### ELITE PLAYERS CONCEPT
- PLAYERS MARKED ELITE HAVE THEIR BASE PRICE SET AT 4CR
