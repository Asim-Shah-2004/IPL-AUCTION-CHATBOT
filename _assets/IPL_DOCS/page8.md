### POWERCARDS

THESE ARE SPECIAL CARDS WHICH CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE GAME AT ANY POINT IN THE AUCTION. YOU CAN BUY THEM AT THE START OF THE GAME. THERE WILL BE 5 TYPES OF POWER CARDS ON OFFER –

1. GODS EYE
2. FOCUS FIRE
3. DOUBLE RTM
4. SILENT RESERVES
5. SPECIAL POWER CARD (FOR PRE-EVENT WINNERS)

### The power cards are

1. GODS EYE:
   - THIS CARD CAN BE USED TO KNOW THE HIGHEST AMOUNT IN CASE OF A CLOSED BIDDING.

   - FOR EXAMPLE: IF THE BIDDING OF MS DHONI GOES INTO A CLOSE BIDDING ROUND (> 17CR) AND MI WISHES TO KNOW THE MAX PRICE AVAILABLE FOR WHICH THEY CAN BUY MSD, THEN THEY MAY USE THE GOD’S EYE POWERCARD TO KNOW THE HIGHEST BIDDING AMOUNT SUBMITTED BY ONE OR MORE TEAMS.

   - THERE WILL BE ONLY 1 GOD’S EYE CARD AVAILABLE IN 1 SLOT AND IT CAN BE USED ONLY ONCE THROUGHOUT THE AUCTION

2. FOCUS FIRE:
   - IF YOU OWN THIS CARD, AT ANY POINT IN THE AUCTION YOU CAN PUT THE PLAYER BACK IN AUCTION AND YOU WILL ALSO GET BACK THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE PLAYER.

   - EXAMPLE: IF YOU BUY MS DHONI FOR 15 CR IN THE BEGINNING OF THE AUCTION BUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE AUCTION YOU REALIZE THAT YOU NEED THE MONEY OR YOU FEEL 15 CR IS TOO MUCH TO SPEND, YOU CAN USE THE FOCUS FIRE CARD AND WITH THAT YOU WILL GET YOUR 15 CR BACK AND MS DHONI WOULD BECOME AN UNSOLD PLAYER AND WILL COME BACK IN THE AUCTION FOR THE TEAMS TO BID FOR LATER.

   - THERE WILL BE ONLY 1 FOCUS FIRE CARD AVAILABLE IN 1 SLOT.

3. DOUBLE RTM (RIGHT TO MATCH):
   - AFTER THE AUCTION OF THE TEAMS IS DONE, EACH TEAM WILL GET A RTM CARD WHICH THEY CAN USE AT ANY TIME DURING THE AUCTION.

   1. IF A TEAM BUYS DOUBLE RTM THEN THEY CAN RETAIN TWO PLAYERS WHICH CAN ADD TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

   2. IF ROHIT SHARMA IS SOLD TO CSK FOR 12 CR, THEN MI CAN USE THE RTM CARD AND GET ROHIT SHARMA FOR 12 CR.

   3. BUT NOTE THAT RTM CAN BE USED ONLY ON THE PLAYER OF THE TEAM YOU OWN, SO MI CAN’T USE THE RTM CARD ON MS DHONI.

   4. ALSO, THIS CARD CAN BE USED ONLY ONCE I.E., ONLY ON 1 PLAYER BY A TEAM. DOUBLE RTM COMES INTO PLAY HERE GIVING AN EDGE TO THE TEAM HAVING IT.
4. SILENT RESERVES:
   - THE "SILENT RESERVES" POWER CARD ALLOWS A TEAM TO STRATEGICALLY RESERVE TWO PLAYERS DURING THE INITIAL STAGES OF AN IPL AUCTION WITHOUT REVEALING THIS INFORMATION TO OTHER COMPETING TEAMS.

   1. THIS MOVE ENABLES THE TEAM TO DISCREETLY SECURE THEIR PREFERRED PLAYERS, KEEPING THEM IN THE SHADOWS UNTIL LATER IN THE AUCTION. THIS COVERT ADVANTAGE ALLOWS THE TEAM TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE EDGE, STRATEGICALLY UNVEILING THEIR RESERVED PLAYERS AT A TIME OF THEIR CHOOSING, CATCHING OTHER TEAMS OFF GUARD AND POTENTIALLY ALTERING THE DYNAMICS OF THE BIDDING PROCESS TO THEIR FAVOR.

5. SILENT HEIST (SPECIAL POWER CARD FOR PRE-EVENT WINNERS):

   1. INTRODUCING THE "SILENT HEIST" POWER CARD, AN EXCLUSIVE ADVANTAGE FOR PRE-EVENT WINNERS IN THE IPL AUCTION. TOP 5 WINNERS FROM THE PRE EVENT WOULD BE GIVEN THIS POWER CARD.

   2. WITH THIS CARD, TEAMS WOULD KNOW ABOUT THE BLIND BID PLAYER BEFOREHAND AND THEY CAN PREPARE A RIDDLE FOR THAT PLAYER. ALONG WITH THIS THE TEAM HAS TO SUBMIT A PRICE RANGE (FOR EG 13-15 CR) FOR THAT PLAYER AS TO UNDER WHAT RANGE COULD THAT PLAYER BE SOLD. IF THE PLAYER GETS SOLD UNDER THAT RANGE THEN THEY’LL GET THE PLAYER AT A FLAT PRICE OF 10CR. BUT IF THE GUESS DOESN'T COME OUT RIGHT, THEN IT WOULD GO TO THE HIGHEST BIDDING TEAM. THEY CAN BID FOR THE PLAYER AS WELL IF THEY WISH TO.

   AUCTION 2024

   3. THE "SILENT HEIST" POWER CARD THUS PROVIDES A TACTICAL ADVANTAGE, ALLOWING THE TEAM TO NAVIGATE BLIND BIDS EFFICIENTLY AND SECURE DESIRABLE PLAYERS WITH PRECISION WHILE MAINTAINING SECRECY ABOUT THEIR TRUE VALUATION.
