- EVERY PLAYER HAS ONE OVERALL RATING (OUT OF 100) AND 6 SUB RATINGS (OUT OF 10).
- THE SIX SUB RATINGS ARE:
  - POWER PLAY BATTING
  - BOWLING
  - MID OVER BATTING
  - BOWLING
  - DEATH OVER BATTING
  - BOWLING

Teams are expected to make a list of 6 columns in rough for their convenience for these 6 cateogories and keep placing the players into the categories as and when they buy a player(keeping in mind the maximum number categories allowed for batting/bowling).
The final calculation part will be done on the website itself wherein users would just have to drag the players into each of the categories and click on submit once they have made their allocation and are ready to see their final score and leaderbord position.
