# bonous points

### BATTING
- THERE WILL BE 3 CATEGORIES: POWERPLAY (PPL), MIDDLE OVERS (MO), AND DEATH OVERS (DTH).
- YOU MUST CHOOSE 4 PLAYERS FOR THE POWERPLAY CATEGORY, 4 PLAYERS FOR MIDDLE CATEGORY, AND 3 PLAYERS FOR DEATH CATEGORY FOR BATTERS.
- IF THE SUM IS ABOVE 90% THEN 5 BONUS POINTS (STRICTLY >90% OF MAX POINTS), ABOVE 80% THEN 3 BONUS POINTS (STRICTLY >80 OF MAX POINTS), 70% OR ABOVE THEN 1 BONUS POINT (>=70% OF MAX POINTS). LESS THAN 70% NO BONUS POINTS.
- 1 BATSMAN CAN BE USED IN MAX 2 CATEGORIES. (BAT PPL, BAT MID, BAT DTH)


### BOWLING
- YOU MUST CHOOSE 3 PLAYERS FOR POWERPLAY, 3 PLAYERS FOR MIDDLE, AND 4 PLAYERS FOR DEATH.
- THE BONUS POINT SYSTEM IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OF POINTS WILL BE THE SAME AS BATTING.
- 1 BOWLER CAN BE USED IN MAXIMUM 2 CATEGORIES (ANY 2).
- LIKE IF A PLAYER HAS 9,8,9 AS HIS RATINGS THEN YOU CAN USE HIM FOR THE FIRST AND THE LAST CATEGORY AS PER YOUR TEAM REQUIREMENT.

### ALL-ROUNDER
- AS YOU KNOW EACH PLAYER WILL HAVE 6 SUB RATINGS, BUT FOR BATTER, ALL THE BOWLING RATINGS WOULD BE 0 AND FOR BOWLERS, ALL THE BATTING RATINGS WOULD BE 0 (POWERPLAY, MIDDLE, AND DEATH).
- FOR ALL-ROUNDERS, ALL 6 RATING PARAMETERS WILL HAVE VALUE AND THUS THEY CAN BE USED AS BATTER (IN ANY OF THE 3 CATEGORIES) OR BOWLERS (IN ANY OF THE 3 CATEGORIES) OR BOTH.
- 1 ALL-ROUNDER CAN BE USED IN MAXIMUM 4 CATEGORIES (2 IN BATTING AND 2 IN BOWLING).

Teams are suggested to form 3 columns each for the batting and bowling in excel sheet for their convenience as it would be easy to keep track of the criterias to fulfil.As the player is sold to the team ,they can put that player in their preferred slot of batting or bowling, for example if rohit sharma has batting 10(powerplay),9(middle-order),8(death), then the team can allocate him in powerplay and middle order as each batsman can be put in max 2 categories ,same goes for bowling as well.
By doing this the teams can decide as to what category is yet to fullfil and which players addition would earn then bonus points as each category has certain required players as mentioned earlier.
